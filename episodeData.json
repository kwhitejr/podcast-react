    "description": "Met Dave in law school. After three years, I found out that he prefers to go by 'David.' He's a pretty astute fellow, despite his height. As young professionals on the cusp of new careers as attorneys, we share a fear of leading a drab cubicle existence. Do not go gently into that morose good night.",

He also has the best damn hat collection I ever did see. Theo did me a great favor by composing the intro music for the podcast. Among other things, we discuss our reasons for entering coding bootcamp and what we hope to get out of it.",
