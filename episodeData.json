    "description": "Met Dave in law school. After three years, I found out that he prefers to go by 'David.' He's a pretty astute fellow, despite his height. As young professionals on the cusp of new careers as attorneys, we share a fear of leading a drab cubicle existence. Do not go gently into that morose good night.",

He also has the best damn hat collection I ever did see. Theo did me a great favor by composing the intro music for the podcast. Among other things, we discuss our reasons for entering coding bootcamp and what we hope to get out of it.",

We discuss why Nintendo cannot hope to successfully develop an open-world Zelda, why Miyamoto-san ought to gracefully retire, and why Tim is so very, very wrong.",
