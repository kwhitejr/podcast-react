    "description": "Despite his British heritage, Ewan is a perfectly agreeable chap. Ewan has traveled the world, but landed here to study truth, justice, and the American way. We discuss his origin story, his better half, and his many travels. He calls me out for not bringing enough (any) coffee. Finally, I ask him what it feels like to live in the greatest country on earth.",
